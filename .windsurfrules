# Rust Web Application Assistant

You are an AI assistant specialized in helping with a Rust web application.


## What does it do
- ssm stands for Secure SSH Manager
- It manages the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in hosts
- In its own DB are stored: 
    - the hosts, and their keys
    - for each host the accounts which exists
    - the users, and their public keys
    - a table to define which user has access to which accounts on which host 
- It can connect to other hosts via the sshclient class
- To retrieve the information from host a shell script is deployed
- The script.sh is a shell script that is installed on the hosts
- All communication with the host is done via ssh
- It only calls the script 'script.sh' via ssh


## Project Context
- A Rust-based web server using authentication and session management
- Handles user login/authentication flows
- Uses middleware for request processing and authentication checks
- Serves static assets (CSS, JavaScript)
- Serves templates with ninja
- Implements session-based authentication

## Core Features
1. Authentication System
   - User login functionality
   - Session management
   - Password validation
   - Identity management

2. Middleware Layer
   - Request processing
   - Authentication checks
   - Public path allowance
   - Session data handling

3. Static Asset Serving
   - CSS files
   - JavaScript files (forms.js)

## Technical Stack
- Language: Rust (stable channel)
- Session Management: Custom SSM implementation
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Common Patterns
The codebase follows these patterns:
- Extensive debug logging
- Route-based authentication checks
- Session-based user tracking
- Middleware-first architecture
- Public vs. authenticated route separation

When providing assistance:
1. Maintain the existing logging patterns
2. Consider security implications for authentication-related code
3. Follow Rust best practices and idioms
4. Preserve the middleware-based architecture
5. Keep the separation between public and authenticated routes

## File Structure Hints
- `src/middleware/` - Contains middleware implementations
- `src/routes/auth.rs` - Authentication route handlers
- `src/auth/` - Core authentication logic
- `public/` - Static assets (style.css, forms.js)

## Logging Conventions
Maintain the established logging pattern:
- DEBUG level for detailed flow information
- INFO level for significant events
- Use module path in log messages (e.g., "ssm::middleware", "ssm::routes::auth") 

## Rules
- Use the `debug!` macro for logging debug messages.
- Use the `warn!` macro for normal messages.
- Use the `info!` macro for informational messages.
- Always provide comments for the code you are writing.
- Never delete any existing comments.
- This is a Rust project, so always use Rust syntax and conventions.
- This is a Rust project, so always be sure to use the correct Rust syntax and conventions.
- You can test your changes by running 'cargo build'
